        <item>It is good business practice to prepare a bank reconciliation statement
        each time a bank statement is received. The reconciliation statement
        should be prepared as quickly as possible so that any queries –
        either with the bank statement or in the firm’s cash book – can be resolved.
        Many firms will specify to their accounting staff the timescales for preparing
        bank reconciliation statements. For example, if the bank statement is
        received weekly, then the reconciliation statement should be
        prepared within five working days.</item>
        <item>“You appear to be a mass of contradictions,” Dr. Washburn said. “There‟s a subsurface
violence almost always in control, but very much alive. There‟s also a pensiveness that seems
painful for you, yet you rarely give vent to the anger that pain must provoke.”
“You‟re provoking it now,” said the man.
“And we‟ll continue to do so, as long as there‟s progress.”

        <item>Let me give you an example.” The doctor put the clipboard down and got out of the chair.
He walked to a primitive cupboard against the wall, opened a drawer, and took out a large
automatic handgun. The man with no memory tensed in his chair; Washburn was aware of the
reaction. “I‟ve never used this, not sure I‟d know how to, but I do live on the waterfront.” He

        <item>Bourne held up his hand. “Forgive me, but that strikes me as a judgment based on false
gratitude. You say you have a respect for facts—then look at them. I repeat: you heard what they

envelopes were filled with money and delivered to me to fulfill certain obligations. I‟d say those
